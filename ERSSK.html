      <h1>Background history</h1>
      <p>
        The Eritrean Refugees Secondary School in Kassala, commonly known as
        “UNESCO School”, was set up with the backing of visionary Eritrean
        Liberation Front (ELF) initiatives, and with funding of the United
        Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1977. The UNHCR continued
        funding the school until 1999, providing Eritrean refugees the
        opportunity to continue receiving the high quality of education the
        school is renowned for in English medium of instruction. It had run by a
        highly dedicated and experienced Eritrean School Administrators and
        teachers. Since its establishment in 1977, the school produced hundreds
        of outstanding graduates who have continued university level education
        or pursued other professions, and now are engaged in highly rewarding
        professional jobs around the world. Following the withdrawal of
        financial support from UNHCR in 1999, the Catholic Church in Kassala
        stepped in to provide financial and material support to the school.
        However, following the COVID-19 global pandemic the Catholic Church
        cutting its funding to the school as the result of that, the school is
        facing serious existential challenges. Nevertheless and despite all the
        challenges, the school has continued rendering its renowned educational
        services to hundreds of Eritrean refugees in Kassala with generous help
        from Eritrean communities, including ex-student of the school.
