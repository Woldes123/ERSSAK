        <p>
          The Eritrean Refugees Secondary School in Kassala, commonly known as
          “UNESCO School”, was set up with the backing of visionary Eritrean
          Liberation Front (ELF) initiatives, and with funding of the United
          Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1977. The UNHCR
          continued funding the school until 1999, providing Eritrean refugees
          the opportunity to continue receiving the high quality of education
          the school is renowned for in English medium of instruction. It had
          run by a highly dedicated and experienced Eritrean School
          Administrators and teachers. Since its establishment in 1977, the
          school produced hundreds of outstanding graduates who have continued
          university level education or pursued other professions, and now are
          engaged in highly rewarding professional jobs around the world.
